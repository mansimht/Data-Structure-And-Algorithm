Encapsulation: combine all data and behaviour in single object. There class created and it contain object havings different tasks. Encapsulation bundle toogether related data and behaviour and limit data scope.\n","\n","2. Abstraction: It is ability to hide complex logic from the user making the code write easier to use in other  places. A good example is sending email- open email client, type email and content and send. Like we just call class method directly without understand the logic behind the class\n","\n","3. Inheritance: One class inherit all functionalities and attributes from another  class or multiple classes.\n","\n","4. Polymorphism: It means having multiple forms.
