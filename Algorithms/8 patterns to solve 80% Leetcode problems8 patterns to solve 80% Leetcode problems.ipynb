Sliding window pattern:  use when input will be array,stirng or linked list and need to find subset of list\n","2. Subset pattern: find all combinations of elements in given set- permutation= breath first search\n","3. Binary search: rotated search in array. Devide search space in half again and again. Need to modified binary search.  Core binary search need to visualize where left and right pointer end up where array contain duplicates and array doesnâ€™t contain target. Bisect module is improve binary search\n","4. Top K elements: select k element in larger dataset with given condition. Input would be linear data structure here. Keep track of k number. So you can use heap here. So if new number is larger then k th largest number then we can replace kth number with new number and thus way will get smallest number\n","5. BFS Tree: Visits every node of tree and uses recursion and backtrack\n","6. Topological Sort: when arrangement is in specific order when they have dependencies on each other. Useful for DAG(one way connection and no cycle)\n","7. Two pointer: iterate sorted array, 2 pointer and moving pointer smartly\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fbdPi-nJWffW"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"-2na0PdRWlAc"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
