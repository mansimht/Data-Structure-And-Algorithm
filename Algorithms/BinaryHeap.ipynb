The same property must be recursively true for all binary tree\n","- It is a complete tree(All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible). This property of binary heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array\n","- Value of any given node must be less then value of their 2 children, this case is called mimimum heap\n","- But in the case of root is greater than its children's value, this case it's called maximum heap\n","\n","**Why we need a binary heap?**\n","\n","Ex. Find the minimum or maximum number among a set of numbers in logN time. nd also we ant to make sure that inserting numbers doesn't take more than O(logN)time\n","\n","**Possible Solution:**\n","1. Store the number in sorted array- Find minimumm: O(1) time complexity.\n","   But if we want to insert a number at begining then  shift all element right. So at insertion O(n) time complexity.. So it is not good solution\n","2. Linked List: Store the nmbers in Linked List in orted manner. AGain here also while insertion we have to traverse through the linkedlist to fibd the appropriate place for the node to be inserted. This will also take O(n) time compelxity\n","3. SO binary heap is final solution.WIth using binary heap, we can find out the minimum or maximum number from the set of numbers in O(logn) time.
